#Hi , welcome to the Approximate Number System test! In this test, you will be given a few sets of images with homegenous-sized dots on both sides, you are then required to select which side (left/right) has more dots. The test will take approximately 3 minutes to complete, good luck! 
#All png files are dot images of different ratios used in the test. 

#Run the first cell to start the test.
