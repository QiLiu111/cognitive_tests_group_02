#In the new version of this test, buttons were added. This is because most of the feedbacks given from the peer review session were "too lengthy" and "too difficult". By adding buttons, participants can choose from the potential answers shown which will decrease the time taken and difficultness. In addition, a bug was identified during peer review session. An error will occur if a string instead of index was entered as an answer. Buttons were added to address this issue too. Besides that, timeout was added as well. This is to prevent participants spending too much time on a question, affecting the validity of this test in assessing participants' maths ability. Hence, the maximum time to answer a question was set to 5 seconds.
